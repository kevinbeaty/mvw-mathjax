Extends default MVW theme to render LaTeX using the MathJax [CDN][1].  Serves as an example of using custom themes and python markdown extensions in MVW.

Include `theme: mathjax` at the beginning of your file to enable MathJax rendering. LaTeX can be included inline between single dollar signs or in blocks between double dollar signs.

See the MVW [math example][2] for a demo.
